# Using the Azure provider extension with Gardener as end-user

The [`core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1.Shoot` resource](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/example/90-shoot.yaml) declares a few fields that are meant to contain provider-specific configuration.

In this document we are describing how this configuration looks like for Azure and provide an example `Shoot` manifest with minimal configuration that you can use to create an Azure cluster (modulo the landscape-specific information like cloud profile names, secret binding names, etc.).

## Provider Secret Data

Every shoot cluster references a `SecretBinding` which itself references a `Secret`, and this `Secret` contains the provider credentials of your Azure subscription.
This `Secret` must look as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: core-azure
  namespace: garden-dev
type: Opaque
data:
  clientID: base64(client-id)
  clientSecret: base64(client-secret)
  subscriptionID: base64(subscription-id)
  tenantID: base64(tenant-id)
```

Please look up https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal as well.

## `InfrastructureConfig`

The infrastructure configuration mainly describes how the network layout looks like in order to create the shoot worker nodes in a later step, thus, prepares everything relevant to create VMs, load balancers, volumes, etc.

An example `InfrastructureConfig` for the Azure extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: InfrastructureConfig
networks:
  vnet: # specify either 'name' and 'resourceGroup' or 'cidr'
    # name: my-vnet
    # resouceGroup: my-vnet-resource-group
    cidr: 10.250.0.0/16
  workers: 10.250.0.0/19
  # natGateway:
  #   enabled: false
  # serviceEndpoints:
  # - Microsoft.Test
zoned: false
# resourceGroup:
#   name: mygroup
#identity:
#  name: my-identity-name
#  resourceGroup: my-identity-resource-group
#  acrAccess: true
```

The `networks.vnet` section describes whether you want to create the shoot cluster in an already existing VNet or whether to create a new one:

* If `networks.vnet.name` and `networks.vnet.resourceGroup` are given then you have to specify the VNet name and VNet resource group name of the existing VNet that was created by other means (manually, other tooling, ...).
* If `networks.vnet.cidr` is given then you have to specify the VNet CIDR of a new VNet that will be created during shoot creation.
You can freely choose a private CIDR range.
* Either `networks.vnet.name` and `neworks.vnet.resourceGroup` or `networks.vnet.cidr` must be present, but not both at the same time.

The `networks.workers` section describes the CIDR for a subnet that is used for all shoot worker nodes, i.e., VMs which later run your applications.
The specified CIDR range must be contained in the VNet CIDR specified above, or the VNet CIDR of your already existing VNet.
You can freely choose this CIDR and it is your responsibility to properly design the network layout to suit your needs.

In the `networks.serviceEndpoints[]` list you can specify the list of Azure service endpoints which shall be associated with the worker subnet. All available service endpoints and their technical names can be found in the (Azure Service Endpoint documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview).

The `networks.natGateway` section contains configuration for the Azure NatGateway which can be attached to the worker subnet of the Shoot cluster. The NatGateway is currently optional and can be enabled/disabled via the field `networks.natGateway.enabled`. If the NatGateway is not deployed then the outgoing traffic initiated within the Shoot cluster will be routed via cluster LoadBalancer (default behaviour, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections#scenarios)). **Restrictions:** The NatGateway is currently only available for zoned clusters (`.zoned=true`, see [#43](https://github.com/gardener/gardener-extension-provider-azure/issues/43) for more details) and it will not be deployed zone-redundant yet. Furthermore, the Azure NatGateway is not yet generally available (GA) from Azure side, hence, you need to register your subscription to participate in the preview for NatGateway.

Via the `.zoned` boolean you can tell whether you want to use Azure availability zones or not.
If you don't use zones then an availability set will be created and only basic load balancers will be used.
Zoned clusters use standard load balancers.

In the `identity` section you can specify an [Azure user-assigned managed identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview#how-does-the-managed-identities-for-azure-resources-work) which should be attached to all cluster worker machines. With `identity.name` you can specify the name of the identity and with `identity.resourceGroup` you can specify the resource group which contains the identity resource on Azure. The identity need to be created by the user upfront (manually, other tooling, ...). Gardener/Azure Extension will only use the referenced one and won't create an identity. Furthermore the identity have to be in the same subscription as the Shoot cluster. Via the `identity.acrAccess` you can configure the worker machines to use the passed identity for pulling from an [Azure Container Registry (ACR)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro).

Adding, exchanging or removing the identity will require a rolling update of all worker machines in the Shoot cluster.

Currently, it's not yet possible to deploy into existing resource groups, but in the future it will.
The `.resourceGroup.name` field will allow specifying the name of an already existing resource group that the shoot cluster and all infrastructure resources will be deployed to.

Apart from the VNet and the worker subnet the Azure extension will also create a dedicated resource group, route tables, security groups, and an availability set (if not using zoned clusters).

## `ControlPlaneConfig`

The control plane configuration mainly contains values for the Azure-specific control plane components.
Today, the only component deployed by the Azure extension is the `cloud-controller-manager`.

An example `ControlPlaneConfig` for the Azure extension looks as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: azure.provider.extensions.gardener.cloud/v1alpha1
kind: ControlPlaneConfig
cloudControllerManager:
  featureGates:
    CustomResourceValidation: true
```

The `cloudControllerManager.featureGates` contains a map of explicitly enabled or disabled feature gates.
For production usage it's not recommend to use this field at all as you can enable alpha features or disable beta/stable features, potentially impacting the cluster stability.
If you don't want to configure anything for the `cloudControllerManager` simply omit the key in the YAML specification.

## Example `Shoot` manifest (non-zoned)

```

## CSI volume provisioners

Every Azure shoot cluster that has at least Kubernetes v1.18 will be deployed with the Azure Disk CSI driver and the Azure File CSI driver.
Both are compatible with the legacy in-tree volume provisioners that were deprecated by the Kubernetes community and will be removed in future versions of Kubernetes.
End-users might want to update their custom `StorageClass`es to the new `disk.csi.azure.com` or `file.csi.azure.com` provisioner, respectively.
Shoot clusters with Kubernetes v1.17 or less will use the in-tree `kubernetes.io/azure-disk` and `kubernetes.io/azure-file` volume provisioners in the kube-controller-manager and the kubelet.
